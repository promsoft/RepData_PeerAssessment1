## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.table(unz('activity.zip'
                   , 'activity.csv')
                   , header = TRUE
                   , sep = ","
                   , stringsAsFactors=F
                   , colClasses = c('integer', 'Date', 'integer')
                   )
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
steps.per.day <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, sum, na.rm=T)
hist(steps.per.day, main='total number of steps taken each day', xlab='steps per day')
print(mean(steps.per.day))
print(median(steps.per.day))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
